To do:
	
D7 - Reed Sensor D0-6 x1 0
	use internal pull-up resistor 
	requires ground

D6 - DHT - D3 x1 (working on D2,4) #done -
	0.) 1 2 - 4
	1.) positive
	2.) pin + (4.7k) pullup resistor
	4.) negative
	requires ground and 3v
		use FLOAT or DOUBLE to store results
		5v tolerant - must test

A4 - IR LED Control D0-3 x1 #done 
	IR LED
		FV (V): 1.5~1.6
		FC (mA): 60mA, 120mA peak for 10% Pulse Width
		35ma at 100r
		75ma at 47r
		I used 22r
	2N2222
		flat side up:
		3E-tognd 2B-topin 1C-positive in
			To control a 5v LED at 100ma, use a 2kr base resistor
				Value calculated with transistor calculator
			what did I use?
		requires ground to 5v
A5 - Capture (with a transistor), A0-5/D0-6 x1 -
	IR Receiver
		FV (V): 1.1~1.4
		FC (mA): 30 ma; 75 ma peak;
	VS1838B (CMOS lvl digital signal - output matching TTL)
		1-out 2-gnd 3-vcc
		Vcc: 3-5
		Hz: 38Hz
		requires a digital input pin

A2,3 Relay control - D0-6 x2 #Done 65
	requires ground and 5v

A0,1 - Two buttons w/ LEDs - D0-6 x2 #Done -
	LED must run parallel to (200) pulldown resistor
	requires ground and 5v

Notes
	20ma max a pin
	gnd are connected
	All pins except A3 and DAC are 5V tolerant (when not in analog mode). If used as a 5V input the pull-up/pull-down resistor must be disabled.

	Analog pins can be used as Digital Pins too

	D0-3 #2,3 = Analog output via PWM
	A4-5 #4,5 = PWM Analog output

optional - reed switch and remote for garage

when led 

a5 unable to attach interrupt

future:
	research mosfets / dimmer / optocouplers
	experiment with pcb ordering
	experiment wtih low level switching on led
