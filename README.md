# Personal Project
This is a custom built wifi enabled smart switch Iâ€™ve built for personal use. It also is connected to my garage door opener, and has a built in IR blaster. DHT 22 temperature sensor is also present to check for overheating.

## Project Criteria:
* Microcontroller: Particle.io (Particle Photon)
* Garage Door Remote: Craftsman 315mhz Remote
* Light Switch: 2CH 3.3-5V Relay Kit
* Temp Sensor: DHT 22
* IR Emitter: TSAL6100
* IR Recorder: TSOP34438
* Pseudo MVC approach: Event Assignment > Events > Action
